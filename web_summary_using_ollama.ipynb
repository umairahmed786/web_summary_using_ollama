    "## WEB Summary Using Ollama\n",
    "Summarizing a webpage to use an Open Source model running locally via Ollama rather than OpenAI\n",

    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. No API charges - open-source\n",
    "2. Data doesn't leave your box\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Significantly less power than Frontier Model\n",

    "## Installation of Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and install!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once complete, the ollama server should already be running locally.  \n",
    "If you visit:  \n",

    "\n",
    "You should see the message `Ollama is running`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If not, bring up a new Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows) and enter `ollama serve`  \n",
    "And in another Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows), enter `ollama pull llama3.2`  \n",
    "Then try [http://localhost:11434/](http://localhost:11434/) again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Ollama is slow on your machine, try using `llama3.2:1b` as an alternative. Run `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` from a Terminal or Powershell, and change the code below from `MODEL = \"llama3.2\"` to `MODEL = \"llama3.2:1b\"`\n"
